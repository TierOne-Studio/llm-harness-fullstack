# Recipe: Build

## Purpose

Execute an approved plan without skipping verification.

## Non-Negotiables

- P0 safety and approval gates override this recipe.
- Git commits require explicit user approval.
- The main agent remains the application-code writer unless the runtime has a proven bounded write-scope implementation agent.
- Do not mark a task complete until its tests and triggered reviewers are green or non-blocking.

## Procedure

1. Read the plan and list remaining tasks.
2. Execute one task at a time.
3. For code tasks, run failing test first, implement, and run green verification.
4. Run `quality-runner` when available, or run the plan's quality commands directly.
5. Invoke P4 reviewers as triggered.
6. Ask for commit approval before each commit command.
7. Continue until all plan tasks are complete or a blocker requires user input.

## Output

Report task status, commands run, reviewer verdicts, open risks, and next task.
