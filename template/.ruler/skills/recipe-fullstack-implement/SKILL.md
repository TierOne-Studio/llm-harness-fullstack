# Recipe: Fullstack Implement

## Procedure

1. Run `requirements-analyzer`.
2. Run `codebase-analyzer` per affected tier.
3. Create or update backend, frontend, shared-contract, and e2e SPEC/design docs as needed.
4. Run `document-reviewer` for each document.
5. Run `design-sync`; stop on conflicts.
6. Run `recipe-plan`.
7. Stop for user approval before implementation.
8. Run `recipe-build` task by task.
9. Run `quality-runner`, P4 reviewers, `spec-steward` POST, `design-sync` POST, and `acceptance-verifier`.

P0 remains dominant throughout the recipe.
