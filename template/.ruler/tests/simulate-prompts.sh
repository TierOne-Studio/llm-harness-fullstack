# simulate-prompts.sh — static skill-trigger simulation for the FULLSTACK harness.
#
# This is NOT an LLM run. It's a static contract test: for each canonical
# (prompt, expected_skills) case, assert that every expected skill's
# description contains enough keywords from the prompt that the LLM's
# description-match heuristic would plausibly load it.
#
# Failure means trigger drift: either a skill description was weakened,
# or the prompt's expected skill list is now stale. Fix the side that's wrong.
#
# Threshold: every expected skill must contain >=1 lowercased prompt token
# (length >= 4) in its description. Stop-words filtered.
#
# Usage: bash .ruler/tests/simulate-prompts.sh
